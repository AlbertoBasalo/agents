Good morning, my name is Warren and I am the Chief Financial Officer of Astro Bookings Corporation.

I am only writing to tell you how our company makes money.

We charge the customers for the seats they reserve in every booking.

Our suppliers also charge us for the successful launches they make through our platform.

We also charge a fee to the suppliers for using our platform.

We are in charge of issuing emitted and storing received invoices.

Clients and suppliers must have a tax ID and a legal address to issue invoices.

We need to keep track of those invoices payment status (pending, completed, failed) and the date.

We will issue an invoice for every launch to the the supplier with a fee for using our platform. The fee will be 1% of the total income of the launch. After 2 successful launches, we will reduce the fee to 0.8%.

On the customer side, we will issue an invoice for each booking with the total cost of the seats reserved.

If the launch is aborted, we will charge a fee of 1000USD to the supplier for the operative costs and refund the money to the customers with the total amount of the booking aborted.

If the customer cancels the booking we will refund a portion of the money in certain situations. The amount will be 90% of the total cost if the cancellation is made 1 year before the launch, and 70% if it is made 3 months before. After that, the customer will not be refunded and seats will be considered sold due to the preparation time of the launch.

Every invoice must have a number, a legal date and an amount. Invoices has a payment record with a status that can be updated by our employees.

Of course each invoice must be related with a booking (when issued to a customer) or a launch (when is issued to a supplier) and must have a recipient (customer or supplier) and an emitter (Astro Bookings Corp. or supplier).

Invoices issued by us, need to be sent as notifications by email to the recipient.

Hope you and your family are safe and well.
