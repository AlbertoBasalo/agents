Hi, I’m Richard Mezzos, I’m writing to ask you to create the software platform to support our operations.

We need something reliable and future-proof that allows us to offer our customers trips _out-of-this-world_.

Our business is being an intermediary between _very very_ big affiliated suppliers and _very very_ rich travel customers. We will charge our suppliers a fee for using our platform.

We need to be able to offer our customers the possibility to book seats on rockets to travel to space. We will charge them for the seats they reserve in every booking.

We need to be able to offer our suppliers the possibility to schedule new rocket launches and manage the bookings of the customers. We will charge them for the launches they make through our platform. They will charge us for the bookings of successful launches.

We hope that you will provide us with an evolutionary solution that can be used by our suppliers, employees and customers to offer, manage and book rocket launches with ease.

Of course we also want to notify our client and providers of each reservation or cancellation or issue on any launch.

**Money is not a problem. But we want a full operating service by the end of 2024.**

In the the following days you will receive specific requirements from our operations, marketing and technology departments.

Regards,
