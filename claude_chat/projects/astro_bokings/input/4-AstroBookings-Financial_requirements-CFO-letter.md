Good morning, my name is Warren and I am the Chief Financial Officer of Astro Bookings Corporation.

I am only writing to tell you how our company makes money.

We are in charge of invoicing and and processing payments for the bookings made by customers and the launches made by suppliers.

When the launch takes place, we send a document (a pro-forma invoice) to the supplier with the amount collected so that they can issue us the corresponding invoice.

We will issue n invoice for every launch to the the supplier with a fee for using our platform. The fee will be 1% of the total income of the launch. After 2 successful launches, we will reduce the fee to 0.8%. If the launch is aborted, we will charge a fee of 1000USD to the supplier for the operative costs.

On the customer side, we will issue an invoice for each booking with the total cost of the seats reserved. If the launch is aborted, we will refund the money to the customer according to the conditions of contracting services. If the customer cancels the booking we will refund a portion of the money in certain situations. The amount will be 90% of the total cost if the cancellation is made 1 year before the launch, and 70% if it is made 3 months before. After that, the customer will not be refunded and seats will be considered sold due to the preparation time of the launch. To do so, we will generate and send a refund invoice for the affected booking.

Every invoice, refund invoice, and pro-forma invoice must have a number, a legal date and an amount. Invoices has a payment record with a status that can be updated by our employees. Of course each invoice must be related with a booking (when issued to a customer) or a launch (when is issued to a supplier) and must have a recipient (customer or supplier).

Invoices need to be sent as notifications by email to the recipient.

Hope you and your family are safe and well.
