## General Instructions

1. Read all instructions before starting.
   1. There are specific instructions for each document.
   2. Use the provided examples as a reference.
2. Ask for requirements as documents or conversations.
   1. Do not assume requirements; ask for clarification.
   2. Take your time to understand the project scope.
3. Generate design documents based on requirements.
   1. Ask for the first document to generate, suggesting the Entity-Relationships.
   2. Get feedback and make changes after each document.
   3. Add generated documents as inputs to generate the next document.
4. For any other document, generate one file for each component.
   1. Use the project name and document name in the file name.
   2. Use concise and clear English for all documents.
   3. Generate in Markdown format.
   4. Name files: `project-name_document-name.md`
   5. Add a timestamp at the beginning of each document.
   6. Cite external sources at the end of the document.

## Document Generation Order

1. Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagram for the entire system
2. Domain Model for each software component
3. Database Schema for each database

### 1. Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagram

Generate the E-R diagram based on the system architecture and user stories.

Instructions:

1. Ask for and read the general requirements, system architecture and user stories.
2. Generate one file for for the whole system.
   1. Use the component name as the title for the file.
3. For the whole system list entities and relationships.
   1. Identify entities and relationships.
   2. List relationships with cardinality.
   3. Create Mermaid diagram code.

Example:

````markdown
# Project: Entity-Relationship Diagram

## Entities

1. `Customer`: A customer who can place orders.
2. `Order`: An order placed by a customer.
3. `Product`: A product that can be ordered.

## Relationships

1. Customer _(1 to 0 or many)_ Order
   - `Customer` _places_ `Order`
   - `Order` _belongs to_ `Customer`
2. Order _(1 to 1 or many)_ Product
   - `Order` _contains_ `Product`
   - `Product` _is part of_ `Order`

## Mermaid Diagram Code

```mermaid
erDiagram
  Customer ||--o{ Order : places
  Order ||--|{ Product : contains
```
````

### 4. Domain Model

You can generate a domain model based on the system architecture, user stories and ER diagram for each software component.

Instructions:

1. Use or ask for any document needed
   1. Formal requirements
   2. System architecture
   3. User stories
   4. ER diagram
2. Ask the user for a software component to generate its domain model.
   1. For that software component, list entities with descriptions, grouped by subdomain.
   2. Generate one file for each software component.
   3. Use the component name as the title for the file.
3. Identify subdomains and list entities under each subdomain.
   1. Group entities based on their relationships and functionalities.
   2. Some entities may belong to multiple subdomains.
   3. Feel free to reuse entities across subdomains.
      1. In such cases use specific subset of attributes for each subdomain.
4. For each entity,
   1. List attributes with data types and descriptions.
   2. Specify primary and foreign keys, optional fields, and derived fields.
   3. Do not add system or operational attributes like `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `createdBy`, `updatedBy`
   4. Specify derived attributes like _totalAmount_ or _fullName_.
   5. Do not add more attributes than the ones from the requirements.

Example:

```markdown
# Project: Domain Model

## üßë‚Äçüíª Web Application & üßë‚Äçüíº API Service

### Customer Management Subdomain

#### Customer

Represents a customer who can place orders.

- **id**: Unique identifier `UUID`
- **firstName**: First name `Text`
- **lastName**: Last name `Text`
- **email**: Email address `Text`
- **age**: Age `Integer` (>18)
- phoneNumber: Phone number `Text`
- _fullName_: firstName + lastName `Text`

### Order Management Subdomain

#### Order

Represents an order placed by a customer.

- **id**: Unique identifier `UUID`
- **customerId**: Customer ID `UUID`
- **orderDate**: Order timestamp `DateTime` [default: now]
- **status**: Order status `Text` [Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled]
- _totalAmount_: Calculated total `Decimal`
- shippingAddress: Shipping address `Text`
```

### 6. Database Schema

You can generate a database schema based on the domain model for each software component and the system architecture.

Instructions:

1. Ask for or use previusly content and read the domain model for each software component.
2. For relational databases, generate DDL scripts with comments.
3. For NoSQL databases, generate JSON schema definitions with comments.

Example:

````markdown
# Project: Database Schema

> Timestamp: DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm

## üìá SQL Database (PostgreSQL)

## Postgres DSL generating instructions

The current instructions for generating PostgreSQL Data Definition Language (DDL) based on the provided domain model involve the following steps and guidelines:

## General Guidelines

1. Strictly adhere to the provided requirements. Do not add features or entities that are not explicitly specified in the requirements or system architecture documents.

2. Pay close attention to the system architecture. Some data may be intended for relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) while other data may be meant for NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).

3. For MongoDB schemas:

   - Utilize nested structures where appropriate to optimize data access and reduce the need for multiple queries.
   - Consider embedding related data that is frequently accessed together.

4. Do not add system or operational attributes such as `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `createdBy`, or `updatedBy` unless explicitly required.

5. When designing schemas for specific components (e.g., customer-facing API), focus only on the data necessary for that component's functionality.

6. Include appropriate indexes to support efficient querying for common operations.

7. For entities that appear in multiple contexts (e.g., User, Customer, Supplier), adjust the attribute set based on the specific needs of each context.

8. Remember to include collections or tables needed for system operations, such as job scheduling, if specified in the requirements.

## PostgreSQL Specific Instructions

1. Use UUID for primary keys where possible.

2. Implement appropriate constraints (CHECK constraints, foreign keys) to maintain data integrity.

3. Create indexes on frequently queried columns and those used in JOIN operations.

4. Use ENUM types for fields with a predefined set of values.

## MongoDB Specific Instructions

1. Use JSON Schema validation to enforce data structure and integrity.

2. Create indexes to support common query patterns, including compound indexes where appropriate.

3. Implement text indexes for fields that require full-text search capabilities.

4. Use nested objects and arrays to represent complex data structures, optimizing for read operations in customer-facing applications.

5. For references between collections, use consistent field names (e.g., `userId`, `launchId`) to maintain clear relationships.

## Final Checks

1. Ensure all required fields from the original requirements are included in the schema.

2. Verify that the schema supports all the operations described in the user stories and system requirements.

3. Check that the data model aligns with the specified system architecture, particularly regarding the split between relational and NoSQL databases.

4. Confirm that no unnecessary fields or collections have been added that weren't part of the original requirements.

5. Validate that the schema allows for efficient querying of data as needed by the various components of the system (e.g., customer web app, supplier portal, employee dashboard).

### Entity and Attribute Naming Conventions

- Table Naming: Use plural nouns in snake_case for tables.
- Column Naming: Use snake_case for all columns names.
- Enum Fields: Use VARCHAR(15) for enum fields to accommodate possible values.
- String Fields: Prefer TEXT for any other string fields.

### General Table Structure

- Primary Keys: Use UUID for primary key fields and name them id.
- Foreign Keys: Use UUID for foreign key fields, and ensure they reference the correct primary key fields in related tables.
- Not Null Constraints: Apply NOT NULL constraints to fields that are mandatory.
- Default Values: Specify default values for fields where applicable (e.g., boolean fields, enum fields...).
- Checks and Constraints: Use CHECK constraints for fields with a limited set of values (e.g., enums, ranges).

### Data Types

UUID: Use for primary keys and foreign keys.
TEXT: Use for variable-length string fields.
VARCHAR(15): Use for enum fields to define a limited set of string values.
INT: Use for integer fields.
DECIMAL(10, 2): Use for fields that store decimal values with two decimal places.
DATE: Use for fields that store dates.
TIMESTAMPTZ: Use for fields that store timestamps with time zone information.
BOOLEAN: Use for boolean fields.
JSON: Use for fields that store JSON data.

```sql
-- Table: customers
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  phone_number TEXT
);

COMMENT ON TABLE customers IS 'Registered customers';

-- Table: orders
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(id),
  order_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('Pending', 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled')),
  shipping_address TEXT
);

COMMENT ON TABLE orders IS 'Customer orders';
```

## üóÇÔ∏è NoSQL Database (MongoDB)

```json
// Collection: Customers
{
  "Customers": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Unique customer ID"
      },
      "firstName": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "First name"
      },
      "lastName": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Last name"
      },
      "email": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Email address"
      },
      "phoneNumber": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Phone number"
      }
    },
    "required": ["_id", "firstName", "lastName", "email"]
  }
}
